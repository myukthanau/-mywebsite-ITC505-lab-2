        <h1>Product Recommendation System using Sentiment Analysis on E-Commerce Application</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The main aim of this paper is to provide a recommender system for customers, by using machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine based on accuracy, comparing performance metrics.</p>
        
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>Methodology involves several steps like gathering a valid data set, pre-processing steps to remove unnecessary data, collaborative filtering of text, applying machine learning algorithms.</p>
        
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Experimenting happens in two stages. Experiment 1 outcome is compared with the second one based on the performance metrics. Two machine learning algorithms are used in this technique like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine.</p>
        
        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>From the results obtained, Naive Bayes machine has the most precise conclusion. So, using sentiment analysis for recommender system, Naive Bayes has the highest preference over support vector machine.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The thesis recognizes the importance of users having a clear understanding of how recommendations are generated, contributing to a more ethical and user-friendly recommendation system. According to the experimental outcomes, the Support Vector Machine algorithm performs the best, with an accuracy rate of 95.03%.</p>

        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>In this HTML structure, I used <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tags to represent the main headings and subheadings of the paper. The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag is used for paragraphs to clearly delineate blocks of text.</p>
        <p>The <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag is used to encapsulate the entire content of the paper as well as the addendum. This semantic element helps in defining distinct sections of the document.</p>
        <p>The <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> tag at the end of the body provides information about the last update of the document, utilizing JavaScript to dynamically insert the last modified date.</p>
